### Introduction

DevOps is a method that integrates and narrows two environments in software development process, developer side and operational side. DevOps becomes a solution that can be offered to improve SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) in current embedded system development process. This paper provides a concept and its implementation to prove that DevOps adoption on embedded system architecture is possible. After doing the research, we found out that it is possible to adopt DevOps on embedded system development, we also provide empirical evidence and analyze the weaknesses about the concept designed.
